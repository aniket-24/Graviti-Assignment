<hr>

- The app takes location inputs of "Origin" & "Destination" and then plots the route
  on maps along with distance.

- There’s an option for users to add multiple stops on the route - when a user adds a stop, it becomes a waypoint between Origin & Destination. Adding stops is optional

- Input validation - Origin & Destination inputs should fetch location from Google
  maps autosuggest. Users should not be able to add anything else.
